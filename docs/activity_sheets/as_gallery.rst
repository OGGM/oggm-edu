Lesson plan 1: Glacier Gallery
==============================

:Author:
    Josie Lino
:Grades:
    High school students
:Brief Description:
    Utilizing the interactive app :ref:`gallery` provided
    by OGGM-Edu, students will be introduced to glaciers and their forms.
:Objectives:
    Upon completion of this lesson, students will be able to:
       - Identify the standard definition of a glacier
       - Compare and contrast the four glacier types presented in the app
:Materials Needed:

    - Computer with access to OGGM-Edu (possibly one computer per group of 2 or 3)
    - A writing utensil and paper

:Lesson Plan:

    - Brainstorm with students to discern what they know about glaciers. This could entail
      asking students to individually write down their initial definition of a glacier, or collaboratively
      create a mind-map that lists the characteristics of a glacier.
    - Open the Glacier Gallery app and highlight the definition of a glacier defined by OGGM-Edu.
      Emphasize that a glacier is a perennial land-mass of ice,
      and highlight the differences between the student-provided
      definition against the OGGM-Edu provided definition of a glacier.
    - Provide short instruction on how to use the Glacier Gallery. Ask students to
      independently (either alone or in small groups) to create a visual representation
      of the similarities and differences between the four glacier types on a piece of paper.
      Provide a short period of allotted time to work and occasionally offer your assistance
      when asked or needed.
    - If not rushed for time, ask students to individually present their findings. Otherwise,
      create your own compare-and-contrast visualization method and use student-input to fill it in.
    - Summarize the key differences between the four glacier types in a method that would allow students to take notes.
    - For the remainder of the lesson, ask students to ask questions.
