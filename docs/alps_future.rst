Possible future improvements
----------------------------

- implementation of uncertainties into the graphic
- possibility to choose between absolute and percentage change of volume
- adding a map in which the user can select glaciers
- implement tick-boxes for choosing the displayed RCP-scenarios
- two dropdown menus to give the opportunity that every region can be compared to every other region/country
