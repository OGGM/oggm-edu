OGGM-Edu in classes and workshops
=================================

OGGM-Edu is still in an early development stage and has not yet been used
as standalone platform for classes or workshops - we encourage you to
try it out!

We use notebooks frequently for our own `lectures <https://fabienmaussion.info/teaching/>`_,
and we are big fans! They allow to convey knowledge in an interactive,
"try as you learn" practical class, and encourage active learning.

Here are a few recommendations based on our own experience:

**Spend at least one hour explaining the notebook and jupyterlab environments**.
Showing their basic features first, then let the students play with a simple and
short notebook. In a second session (after half an hour or so),
summarize the usual pitfalls with them. These are:

- recognize that notebooks are actual files (not something magical on browser)
- aknowledge that the order of execution of cells matter
- aknowledge that errors in cell execution are OK and can be recovered from
- show how to restart with a fresh notebook
- encourage the use of keyboard shortcuts (such as `[shift+enter]` and
  `[ctrl+m] + key`)

**On Binder: avoid bad surprises by explaining them that the sessions are
temporary**. Show how to download and upload files to JupyterLab.

Whatever your learning goals are, **always plan less than that**. You might
find `this blog post <https://medium.com/@jasonjwilliamsny/4-practical-suggestions-for-using-jupyter-notebooks-in-tutorials-9c478c8c0032>`_
and `free online book <https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/>`_ about
teaching with notebooks useful as well.

If you plan to teach about programming aspects as well as about
glaciology, **focus on the content** more than onm the method. Unfortunately
or fortunately, the "fun" aspect of notebooks and the programming challenges
often distract students from what they are actually doing: glaciology and
climatology. We've seen students googling about how to change a colormap before
even trying to analyse the plot they just produced.

If you have the chance of having more experienced students in the room,
**organize peer-mentoring in groups of 2 or 3**. Students are often better
in mentoring each other than yourself.
