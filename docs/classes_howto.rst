OGGM-Edu in classes and workshops
=================================

OGGM-Edu can readily be used in your classes and workshops - we encourage you to
try it out! Depending on your own knowledge about glaciers, this can require
some preparation. Check out :ref:`other_resources` if you are interested in
the fundamentals and online textbook materials.

Currently, we are working on making OGGM-Edu suitable for classes at the
highschool level (using the web applications) and at the university level
(using the programmable notebooks). You will find some help to get you started
below.


Using the OGGM-Edu web apps at the highschool level
---------------------------------------------------

OGGM-Edu can be used to organize a 2 to 4 hours class, possibly even
longer. It could be organized as such:

1. General introduction to glaciers: what is a glacier, where do we find them,
   why are they important?
2. Learn about different glacier types in the :ref:`gallery`.
3. Learn about the glaciers location and their climate with the :ref:`explorer`
   app. Use the sample questions to encourage the students to explore the app
   by themselves or in small groups.
4. For more advanced classes, learn about glacier flow with the :ref:`simulator`.
   This app can be used for a number of different experiments, and can
   be complemented with a `glacier goo <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdeN5CpsW0>`_
   experiment.


Using the OGGM-Edu notebooks at the university level
----------------------------------------------------

We use notebooks frequently for our own `lectures <https://fabienmaussion.info/teaching/>`_,
and we are big fans! They allow to convey knowledge in interactive,
"try as you learn" practicals, and they encourage active learning.

Our notebooks have been used for a one week workshop given to students
in Peru. Read `this blog post <https://oggm.org/2019/12/06/OGGM-Edu-AGU/>`_
for more details.

Here are a few recommendations based on our own experience:

**Spend at least two hours explaining the notebook and jupyterlab environments**.
Showing their basic features first, then let the students play with a simple and
short notebook. In a second session (after an hour or so),
summarize the usual pitfalls:

- recognize that notebooks are actual files (not something magical on browser)
- aknowledge that the order of execution of cells matter
- aknowledge that errors in cell execution are OK and can be recovered from
- show how to restart with a fresh notebook
- encourage the use of keyboard shortcuts (such as `[shift+enter]` and
  `[ctrl+m] + key`)

**On MyBinder: avoid bad surprises by explaining to your class that the sessions
are temporary**. Show your students how to download and upload files to
JupyterLab so that they feel comfortable saving their work from time to time.

Whatever your learning goals are, **always plan less than that**. You might
find `this blog <https://medium.com/@jasonjwilliamsny/4-practical-suggestions-for-using-jupyter-notebooks-in-tutorials-9c478c8c0032>`_
and this `free online book <https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/>`_
about teaching with jupyter notebooks useful as well.

If you plan to teach about programming aspects as well as about
glaciology, **focus on the content** more than on the method. Unfortunately
(or fortunately), the "fun" aspect of notebooks and the programming challenges
often distract students from what they are actually doing: glaciology and
climatology. We've seen students googling about how to change a colormap before
even trying to analyse the plot they just produced.

If you have the chance to have more experienced students in the room,
**organize peer-mentoring in groups of 2 or 3**. Students are often better
in mentoring each other than we are.
