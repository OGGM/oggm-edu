OGGM-Edu in classes and workshops
=================================

OGGM-Edu can readily be used in your classes and workshops - we encourage you to
try it out! Depending on your own knowledge about glaciers, this can require
some preparation. Check out :ref:`other_resources` if you are interested in
the fundamentals and online textbook materials.

Currently, we are working on making OGGM-Edu suitable for classes at the
high school level (using the web applications) and at the university level
(using the web applications and the programmable notebooks).

You will find some help to get you started below!

.. admonition:: New since June 2022! Teaching materials for your glaciology labs

   We recently created two activities based on the OGGM-Edu web apps that
   are suitable for high-school or university students with no previous
   knowledge about glaciers. These activities have been tested in class and
   provide a well defined activity schedule and instructor materials.
   Check them out on the SERC platform:

   - `OGGM-Edu Glaciology Lab 1 - What Makes a Glacier?`_
   - `OGGM-Edu Glaciology Lab 2 - Exploring glacier data`_

Using the OGGM-Edu web apps in high school
------------------------------------------

The OGGM-Edu web apps are well suited for high-school activities.
See for example this
`blog post by PhD students Lilian Schuster and Zora Schirmeister <https://oggm.org/2021/10/04/erasmus-project-obergurgl/>`_
about the 3-day long excursion they organized for a class, with help of OGGM-Edu.

The apps are meant to be used in order:

1. General introduction to glaciers: what is a glacier, where do we find them,
   why are they important?
2. Learn about different glacier types in the :ref:`gallery`.
3. Learn about the glaciers location and their climate with the :ref:`explorer`
   app. Use the sample questions to encourage the students to explore the app
   by themselves or in small groups.
4. For more advanced classes, learn about glacier flow with the :ref:`simulator`.
   This app can be used for a number of different experiments, and can
   be complemented with a `glacier goo <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdeN5CpsW0>`_
   experiment.

Using the OGGM-Edu notebooks at university
------------------------------------------

For students with programming knowledge (or willing to learn!), the OGGM-Edu
notebooks add a layer of depth and interactivity to the apps.

The use of notebooks in classes is expanding rapidly (see for example the
great resource `Teaching and Learning with Jupyter <https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/>`_
for an in-depth introduction). At OGGM, we use notebooks frequently
for our own `lectures <https://fabienmaussion.info/teaching/>`_ or `tutorials <https://oggm.org/tutorials>`_,
and we are big fans! They allow to convey knowledge in an interactive and fun way,
and they encourage active learning.

Visit the `OGGM-Edu-Notebooks <https://oggm.org/oggm-edu-notebooks>`_ webpage
to see them in action! And our :ref:`nbs_in_class` will help you to get
started with your class.

Existing classes based on OGGM-Edu
----------------------------------

Here are some known applications of OGGM-Edu in classes. You can
use them "as is", or as templates for your own classes. We would love to hear
back from you: if you are creating educational resources based on OGGM-Edu,
please :ref:`get in touch <title_contact>` so that we can advertise them!
