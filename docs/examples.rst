Classes based on OGGM-Edu
=========================

This page lists some known applications of OGGM-Edu in classes. You can
use them "as is", or as templates for your own classes. We would love to hear
back from you: if you are creating educational resources based on OGGM-Edu,
please :ref:`get in touch <title_contact>` so that we can advertise them!
