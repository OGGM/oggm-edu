The glacier gallery is an **interactive web application** with which
you can learn (and teach) about the diverse glaciers of the world. It introduces
different glacier types with pictures and explanations. It includes typical
glaciers from nearly all glaciated regions of the world.

How to use it
-------------

The app contains an interactive **map** with marked glaciers. The markers are
color-coded according to the glacierâ€™s type. When the mouse hovers above one,
information about that glacier and a picture of it appears. When you click on
the marker information about the glaciertype pop up in the **infobox** on the
right. The box has a second tap that shows information about glaciers in general.
If you want to choose a different glacier click into the map to delete your
selection and choose a new marker.

Possible future improvements
----------------------------

The application would profit from additional glaciers in regions that are not
covered yet. If you are interested to contribute you can add a glacier and an
image of it into this `list <https://github.com/OGGM/glacier-gallery/blob/master/glacier_data.py>`_.
