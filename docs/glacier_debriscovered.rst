Rock debris from the surrounding landscape is transported by glacier ice motion,
and some glaciers can develop into debris covered glaciers, with a layer of
rock rubble covering part of their ablation zone. This debris cover alters
the ablation rate of the glacier, and therefore its overall interaction with
a forcing climate. Here is a schematic of the control and processes affecting
debris covered glacier systems as presented in
`Nicholson et al., 2021 <https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.662695>`_.
