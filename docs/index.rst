Welcome to OGGM-Edu!
====================

This platform is an educational website about glaciers. It is
currently in construction, but it is growing fast! We already have
some content for you to explore.

:ref:`title_contact` with us if you want to know more and if you want to help us out!

This platform has four main components:

1. :ref:`title_apps`, to illustrate glaciological processes with the
   help of interactive graphics on the web.

OGGM-Edu is an affiliated project of the larger OGGM consortium
(`oggm.org <https://oggm.org>`_). It is mainly the work of volunteers, but we
also had support from various sources:

- The project is supported for a one year period (starting May 2019) by
  the University of Innsbruck, Förderkreis **1669** – **Wissen** schafft
  Gesell **schaft**.
- The project is supported by the German BMBF (project FKZ 01LS1602A).
- We are happy to be supported by `Google Cloud | Data Solutions for Change`_
  who provided us cloud computing and hosting credits.
- Zora Schirmeister (student helper from Oct 2018 to March 2019) was supported
  by the department of
  `Digital Sciences <https://www.uibk.ac.at/zid/abteilungen/lt/>`_ at the
  University of Innsbruck (Neue Medien Projekte - Call 18.03).
- The OGGM e.V. organisation supported the creation of the OGGM-Edu logo
  and of the glacier graphics.
