Acknowledgements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OGGM-Edu is an affiliated project of the larger OGGM consortium
(`oggm.org <https://oggm.org>`_). It is mainly the work of volunteers, but we
also had support from various sources:

- Zora Schirmeister (student helper from Oct 2018 to March 2019) was supported
  by the department of
  `Digital Sciences <https://www.uibk.ac.at/zid/abteilungen/lt/>`_ at the
  University of Innsbruck (Neue Medien Projekte - Call 18.03).
- The OGGM e.V. organisation supported the creation of the OGGM-Edu logo
  and of the glacier graphics.

Thanks to all OGGM-Edu friends and contributors! For a full list of contributors,
