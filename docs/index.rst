Welcome to OGGM-Edu!
====================

This platform is an educational website about glaciers. It is
currently in construction, but it is growing fast.
:ref:`title_contact` with us if you want to help us out!

**This platform has four independent components**:

1. :ref:`title_apps`, to illustrate glaciological processes with the
   help of interactive graphics on the web. The targeted audience is very
   broad, from school children to adults and scientists.
2. :ref:`title_graphics`, open access images and graphics that can be used
   for lectures or presentations.
3. :ref:`title_notebooks`, for students willing to run and develop
   their own experiments. The targeted audience are students at the undergrad
   or graduate level with some programming experience or a tutor to show them
   how to run them.
4. :ref:`title_tuto`, for scientists and users of the Open Global Glacie Model,
   on which most of this website is based.


.. _title_apps:

Interactive apps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These interactive apps can be run on any computer with an internet connection.
We currently only have one, but we have plenty of ideas - so stay tuned!

.. _title_notebooks:

Interactive Notebooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Collection of notebooks with simple experiments explaining one or more
glaciological concepts. They are easier to follow with some background in
programming, but we are working to make them as accessible as possible.
Read our :ref:`notebooks_howto` first if you are new to these things.

.. _title_tuto:

OGGM tutorials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These are more advanced notebooks, for potential and current users of the
OGGM model.

For instructors and teachers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thanks for considering OGGM Edu for your classes! We've gathered some
recommendations and guidelines here. They will be extended soon!

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OGGM-Edu is an affiliated project of the larger OGGM consortium
(`oggm.org <https://oggm.org>`_). It is mainly the work of volunteers, but we
also had support from various sources:

- The project is supported for a one year period (starting May 2019) by
  the University of Innsbruck, Förderkreis **1669** – **Wissen** schafft
  Gesell **schaft**.
- The project is supported by the German BMBF (project FKZ 01LS1602A).
- We are happy to be supported by `Google Cloud | Data Solutions for Change`_
  who provided us cloud computing and hosting credits.
- Zora Schirmeister (student helper from Oct 2018 to March 2019) was supported
  by the department of
  `Digital Sciences <https://www.uibk.ac.at/zid/abteilungen/lt/>`_ at the
  University of Innsbruck (Neue Medien Projekte - Call 18.03).
- The OGGM e.V. organisation supported the creation of the OGGM-Edu logo
  and of the glacier graphics.

We rely on the most awesome open source tools ever to run OGGM Edu! Most
notably:

- `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`_
- `MyBinder <https://mybinder.org>`_
- `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org>`_
- Many (many) packages of the scientific python ecosytem

Last but not least: thanks to all OGGM-Edu friends and contributors!
