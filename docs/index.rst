Welcome to OGGM-Edu!
====================

|

OGGM-Edu is an educational website about glaciers.

Our main goal is to **provide tools and materials for instructors** who
want to teach about glaciers at school, in workshops or at the university. We have been featured in
this
`EGU blog post <https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/cr/2021/03/12/do-you-know-about-oggm-edu-an-open-source-educational-platform-about-glaciers-and-glacier-modelling/>`_!

**OGGM-Edu has four independent and complementary components**:

ðŸ“± :ref:`title_apps`
    | Illustrate glaciological processes with the help of interactive web applications.
    | ðŸŒŽ *Targeted audience*: Everyone! From school children to adults, with or without a scientific background.

ðŸ“ˆ :ref:`title_graphics`
    | Access open images and graphics that can be used for lectures or presentations.
    | ðŸŽ“ *Targeted audience*: Educators, researchers, and presenters looking to use visual materials.

ðŸ““ :ref:`title_notebooks`
    | Guidance to run and develop from simple to complex glacier modelling experiments.
    | ðŸ’» *Targeted audience*: Undergraduate or graduate students with some programming experience, or anyone working with an instructor for hands-on learning.

ðŸ“– :ref:`title_tuto`
    | For current and future users of the Open Global Glacier Model.
    | ðŸ”¬ *Targeted audience*: Graduate students or scientists seeking to understand and use the model effectively.


OGGM-Edu focuses on interactive content and numerical glacier experiments.
We do not provide textbook resources about fundamentals in glaciology, climate science,
or numerical methods: for textbook material, refer to
:ref:`other_resources`, which OGGM-Edu intends to complement.

Interactive apps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These interactive apps can be run on any computer with an internet connection.

.. _title_notebooks:

Interactive Notebooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Collection of notebooks with simple experiments explaining one or more
glaciological concepts. The :ref:`api` provides an intuitive and expressive
interface to the `OGGM model <https://docs.oggm.org>`_, highly simplifying
the development of glacier evolution experiments.
Read our :ref:`notebooks_howto` first if you are new to these things.

.. admonition:: New! Run your class on classroom.oggm.org

    Since 2021, OGGM-Edu offers a new service for instructors:
    `classroom.oggm.org <https://classroom.oggm.org>`_ is a JupyterHub server
    where you and your students can use OGGM-Edu without the burden of installing
    anything. See `this blog post <https://oggm.org/2022/03/19/classroom/>`_
    for an introduction.

For instructors and teachers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thanks for considering OGGM-Edu for your classes! We've gathered some
recommendations and guidelines here.

.. admonition:: New! Teaching materials for glaciology labs now available.

OGGM-Edu is an affiliated project of the larger OGGM consortium
(`oggm.org <https://oggm.org>`_). It is mainly the work of volunteers, but we
also had support from various sources:

- the University of Innsbruck, FÃ¶rderkreis **1669** â€“ **Wissen** schafft
  Gesell **schaft** (2019-2020).
- the German BMBF (project FKZ 01LS1602A, 2017-2019).
- `Google Cloud | Data Solutions for Change`_ who provided cloud computing
  and hosting credits (2019-2020).
- the University of Innsbruck, department of
  `Digital Sciences <https://www.uibk.ac.at/zid/abteilungen/lt/>`_
  (Neue Medien Projekte, 2018).
- the OGGM e.V. organisation, who supported the creation of the OGGM-Edu logo
  and of the glacier graphics.
