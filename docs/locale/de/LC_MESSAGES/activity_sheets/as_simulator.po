"Use the OGGM-Edu provided :ref:`glacier_basics` graphics to visually "

"`AntarcticGlaciers: mass-balance <http://www.antarcticglaciers.org"

"Either provide short instructions on how to use Glacier Simulator, or "

"Either project on a board, or print out and pass, instructions that will "

#: ../../activity_sheets/as_simulator.rst:32
msgid ""
"In beginner mode, set the ELA to 3000m a.s.l and note the equilibrium "

"Choose the “wider top” glacier shape and run the model again. Is the new "
