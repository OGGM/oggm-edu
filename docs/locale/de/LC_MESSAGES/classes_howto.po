"If you plan to teach about programming aspects as well as about "
"glaciology, **focus on the content** more than on the method. "
"Unfortunately (or fortunately), the \"fun\" aspect of notebooks and the "
"programming challenges often distract students from what they are "

"If you have the chance to have more experienced students in the room, "
