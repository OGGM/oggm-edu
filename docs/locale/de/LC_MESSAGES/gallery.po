"The app contains an interactive **map** with marked glaciers. The markers"
" are color-coded according to the glacierâ€™s type. When the mouse hovers "
"above one, information about that glacier and a picture of it appears. "
"When you click on the marker information about the glaciertype pop up in "
"the **infobox** on the right. The box has a second tap that shows "
"information about glaciers in general. If you want to choose a different "
"glacier click into the map to delete your selection and choose a new "
"marker."

"The application would profit from additional glaciers in regions that are"

"glacier and an image of it into this `list <https://github.com/OGGM"
"/glacier-gallery/blob/master/glacier_data.py>`_. You can send us the "
"edited file per mail or with a pull-request. Thanks!"
