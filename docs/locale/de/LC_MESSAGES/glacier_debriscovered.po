"Rock debris from the surrounding landscape is transported by glacier ice "
"motion, and some glaciers can develop into debris covered glaciers, with "
"a layer of rock rubble covering part of their ablation zone. This debris "
"cover alters the ablation rate of the glacier, and therefore its overall "
"interaction with a forcing climate. Here is a schematic of the control "
"and processes affecting debris covered glacier systems as presented in "
"`Nicholson et al., 2021 <https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.662695>`_."
