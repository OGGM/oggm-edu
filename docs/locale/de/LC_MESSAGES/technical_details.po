"The computing environments available via MyBinder are `Docker containers "
"<https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container>`_, or \"software "
"capsules\" that can be created, pushed and pulled online. We create these"
" containers using a few simple configuration files specifying the "
"software packages and python libraries we would like to used in OGGM-Edu."
" These configurations files are found in this repository: "
"`<https://github.com/OGGM/binder>`_"

"MyBinder uses `repo2docker <https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io>`_ to "
"build these environments and stores them in a hidden database. Once "
"built, they won't be built again unless a new change is made to the "
"``OGGM/binder`` repository."

"We use the same principle to build images that can be used by your own "
"JupyterHub deployment, if you have one. These images are available `here "
"<https://hub.docker.com/r/oggm/r2d>`_ and form the base of the Binder "
"environments. Their configuration files are found in this repository: "
"`<https://github.com/OGGM/r2d>`_. We use these in :ref:`oggm_hub`."
