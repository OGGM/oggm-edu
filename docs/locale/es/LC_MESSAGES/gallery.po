"The app contains an interactive **map** with marked glaciers. The markers"
" are color-coded according to the glacier’s type. When you hover the "
"mouse over a marker, information about that glacier and a picture of it "
"appears. When you click on the marker, information about the relevant "
"glacier type pops up in the **infobox** on the right. The box has a "
"second tab that shows information about glaciers in general. If you want "
"to choose a different glacier, click anywhere in the map to clear your "
"selection, and choose a new marker."
