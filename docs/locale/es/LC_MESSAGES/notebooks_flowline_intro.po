"In this notebook we will set-up a simple model run and visualize it "
"afterwards. Therefore we will learn how to define an easy glacier bed and"
" a suitable grid. The learner will implement mass balance in the form of "
"equilibrium line altitude (ELA) and see how his glacier develops in "
"length, volume and area over certain years."

"*Prerequisites:* If you are new to jupyter-notebook, have a look at this "
"short :ref:`notebooks_howto`. This notebook uses the Python programming "
"language. If this is completely new for you, we recommend to go through "
"an introductory tutorial first, or have a teacher or tutor help you out. "
"No need to be a Python expert to be able to use it, though!"
