"Temporary means non-persistent: if you close the tab in which the "

" Therefore, if you want to save your work for later (i.e. to be able to "
"upload it in a future binder session), don't forget to download the files"
" you modified before leaving (see instructions below). **Be aware that a "
"Binder environment will be shut down after 10 minutes of inactivity** "
