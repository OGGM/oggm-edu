"`MyBinder <https://mybinder.org>`_ is a service that allows us to provide"
" online computing environments in which OGGM-Edu notebooks can be read "
"and executed. This is a fantastic service that runs on the cloud - each "
"time a user clicks on an OGGM-Edu binder link, a so-called \"virtual "
"machine\" is spun-up and made accessible via the web-browser."

"**These binder environments are safe, anonymous, and temporary**. "
"Temporary means non-persistent: if you close the tab in which the "
"environment was opened, it is lost. If you open the link again, a new "
"environment will be created for you, without your previous modifications."
" Therefore, if you want to save your work for later (i.e. to be able to "
"upload it in a future binder session), don't forget to download the files"
" you modified before leaving (see instructions below). **Be aware that a "
"Binder environment will be shut down after 10 minutes of inactivity** "
"(leaving your tab/window open will count as “activity” only if visible, "
"i.e. leaving the tab open but navigating elsewhere will eventually shut "
"down your session)."

"resources. However, these resources should be more than enough to run the"
