"In this notebook you will run experiments with a focus on the mass "
"balance gradient. You will see how different mass balance gradients "
"influence the growth of a glacier. Therefore, we calculate our glacier "
"models until they reach an equilibrium state and compare length, area and"
" volume. In addition, we will calculate the volume response times of the "
"glacier models to small climatic changes."
