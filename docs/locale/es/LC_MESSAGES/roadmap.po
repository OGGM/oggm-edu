"As it is now, oggm-edu relies mostly on the models and syntax provided by"

"context:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../roadmap.rst:90
msgid ""
"their functionality is tailored for modelers, not students. I.e. certain "
"variables are not available and/or hidden, the syntax is clumsy, "

#: ../../roadmap.rst:101

"This will require some thinking, but in short: we should think about (1) "

"The vision is that people have a one stop shop (the OGGM-Edu "
"documentation) to learn about the flowline models and what they can do "
"with them, without having to struggle with OGGM itself. The models will "
"be more expressive, use rich output in the notebooks, with the goal to "
