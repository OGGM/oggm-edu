"The computing environments available via MyBinder are `Docker containers "
"<https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container>`_, or \"software "
"capsules\" that can be created, pushed and pulled online. We create these"
" containers using a few simple configuration files specifying the "
"software packages and python libraries we would like to used in OGGM-Edu."

"MyBinder uses `repo2docker <https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io>`_ to "
