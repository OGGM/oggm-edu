"Fortunately, this is very easy to do! All you need to do is to provide "
"the notebooks you would like to run in an online git repository (e.g. "
"GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket). For example, we have created an `oggm-edu-"
"contrib <https://github.com/OGGM/oggm-edu-contrib>`_ with one single "
"notebook to get you started. See also `Lizz' class (in spanish) "
"<https://github.com/ehultee/CdeC-glaciologia>`_ for a real-world example."

"What is happening here? The first part of the link (up to the question "
"mark) is telling MyBinder to use the OGGM environment we are maintaining "
"`here <https://github.com/OGGM/binder>`_. The second part of the link is "

"This was the most basic example. If you want to use other features, like "
