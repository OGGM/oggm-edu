"The world glacier explorer is an **interactive web application** with "
"which you can learn (and teach) about the world's glaciers, their "
"location, their climate, and the ice they store. By \"glaciers\", we mean"
" all glaciers outside of the two continental ice sheets (Greenland and "
"Antarctica)."

msgid ""
"Alternatively, you can start the app `on mybinder "
"<https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/OGGM/world-glacier-"
"explorer/stable?urlpath=panel/app>`_ (slightly slower in general, but a "
"good alternative if our server is saturated). If you want to run the app "
"on your own computer, see :ref:`docker-launch` below."

#: ../../explorer.rst:25
msgid ""
"the **world map** (upper right) displays thg glaciers' location, with the"
" color shading indicating the total glacier area in each pixel. Moving "
"the mouse over a glacier pixel displays its exact glaciated area. When "
"selecting a box on the map, the other elements in the app will update "
"accordingly. Above the map, there is a toolbar: with the \"Box Zoom\" "
"button, you can also zoom into a specific region. Click on \"Reset\" to "
"set the map back to defaults (see the video below for a demo). *Be aware "
"that the map projection is slightly misleading: high latitudes appear "
"much bigger on the map than they really are.*"

"the **bar plots** (left of the map) indicate various statistics about the"
" current glacier selection (default selection: all glaciers). The upper "
"blue bar indicates the number of glaciers selected, the middle blue bar "
"their total area, and the lower blue bar their estimated volume. This "
"volume can be converted to its *sea-level rise equivalent* (in mm), which"
" is the global sea-level rise to be expected if all glacier vanished. "
"Only glaciers *above* sea-level are contributing to this figure, "
"therefore there are two vertical orange bars: *asl* (above sea-level) and"
" *bsl* (below sea-level). See the demo and explanations below on how to "
"use this information."

"the three **climate histograms plots** (lower row) display the "
"distribution of the selected glaciers' climate conditions. The y-axis is "
"given in number of glaciers per bin, and the x-axis in the unit of the "
"target variable (temperature trend, average temperature, average "
"precipitation at the glacier location). Selecting a range of values in "
"these plots also actualizes the map and the rest of the plots (see demo "
