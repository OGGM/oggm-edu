"2018!). We have made tremendous progress in one year: we created this "

"secured funding to continue the platform's development..."

"As it is now, oggm-edu relies mostly on the models and syntax provided by"

"context:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../roadmap.rst:55

"their functionality is tailored for modelers, not students. I.e. certain "
"variables are not available and/or hidden, the syntax is clumsy, "

"it is very difficult to change things in OGGM itself because of backwards"

"it is complex for new users to find the information in the cluttered OGGM"

"This will require some thinking, but at the core, we should think about "

"The vision is that people have a centralized place (the OGGM-Edu "
"documentation) to learn about the flowline models and what they can do "
"with them. The models will be more expressive, use rich output in the "
"notebooks, with the goal to make using the models more fun, intuitive and"
