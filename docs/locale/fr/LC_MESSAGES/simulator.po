"The glacier simulator app runs a numerical glacier model in the "

"<https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/OGGM/glacier_simulator/master?urlpath=panel/app>`_"
" or even locally on your own computer (see :ref:`docker-launch-simulator`"

" "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclined_plane#/media/File:Free_body1.3.svg>`_)."

"the steeper the slope the thinner the glacier (larger along-slope "

msgstr ""

#: ../../simulator.rst:127
msgid ""
"the flatter the slope the larger the equilibrium velocity. When the "
"glacier is thin (has not much mass) the along-slope component is more "
"important. When the glacier is getting thicker the perpendicular "
"component is getting more weight. This partly explains slower velocities "
"for flatter slopes at the start of the model run, and higher velocities "
"when the glacier is getting thicker. For steeper slopes the velocities at"
" the start are large and so more ice is transported downwards, and the "
"glacier stays relatively thin."
