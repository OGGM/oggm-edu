"OGGM-Edu was created as an educational branch of the Open Global Glacier "
"Model (`OGGM <http://oggm.org>`_) project. It is now largely independent "
"and, we hope, can become a useful educational website as we engage more "
"content creators and users! Here is what motivates us:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../why_oggmedu.rst:11
msgid ""
"OGGM-Edu offers **\"hands-on\" and practical activities**, but only very "
"little textbook content: we see the platform as an **interactive "
"complement** to existing :ref:`online resources <other_resources>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../why_oggmedu.rst:14
msgid ""
"Therefore, OGGM-Edu does not attempt to be a \"one stop shop\" for all "
"things related to glaciers: our target groups are **instructors** and "
"**independent learners**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../why_oggmedu.rst:17
msgid ""
"The main themes we are currently working on are the use of **glacier "
"models to learn about glaciers and climate change**, with a focus on "
"**global issues** (see-level rise, water availability, regional and "
"global climate change): these topics have grown out of our own research "
"interests and expertises, but it doesn't have to stay that way. We are "
"open for new ideas as well!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../why_oggmedu.rst:23

"We rely on an **open-source**, **decentralized** and **collaborative** "
"content creation system:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../why_oggmedu.rst:26
msgid ""
"*open-source*: everything is available on our online repositories, with "
"an open license allowing nonrestrictive reuse."
msgstr ""

#: ../../why_oggmedu.rst:28
msgid ""
"*decentralized*: content using OGGM-Edu or that can be run on OGGM-Edu "
"does not have to be stored on our repositories. For example, out `own "
"notebooks <https://github.com/OGGM/oggm-edu-notebooks>`_ are stored in a "
"separate repository, and so are `Lizz' notebooks "
"<https://github.com/ehultee/CdeC-glaciologia>`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../why_oggmedu.rst:33
msgid ""
"*collaborative*: thanks to the decentralized open-source model, any new "
"modification and innovation can feed back into the original website, if "
"the author of the new content chose a license allowing it (which we "
"strongly encourage!)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../why_oggmedu.rst:37
msgid ""
"We use **tools familiar to scientists**, not web developers: our apps and"
" notebooks are written in the Python programming language, this website "
"is written in the `rst format "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_. These tools are much "
"easier to learn and adopt for scientists than, css, javascript or html "
"for example. That way, we hope to engage more people to use and develop "
"the website further."
