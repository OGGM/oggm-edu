In this notebook we will set-up a simple model run and visualize it afterwards. Therefore we will learn how to define an easy glacier bed and a suitable grid. The learner will implement mass balance in the form of equilibrium line altitude (ELA) and see how his glacier develops in length, volume and area over certain years.

*Prerequisites:* If you are new to jupyter-notebook, have a look at this short
:ref:`notebooks_howto`. This notebook uses the Python programming language.
If this is completely new for you, we recommend to go through an introductory
tutorial first, or have a teacher or tutor help you out. No need to be a
Python expert to be able to use it, though!
