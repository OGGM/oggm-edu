==========================

This notebook is an introduction to flowline modelling with OGGM. To open the notebook in your browser:

In this notebook we will set-up a simple model run. Therefore we will learn how to define an easy glacier bed and a suitable grid. The learner will implement mass balance in the form of equilibrium line altitude (ELA) and see how his glacier develep in length, volume and area over certain years.

*Prerequisites:* If you are new to jupyter-notebook, have a look at this short `introduction
<http://edu.oggm.org/en/latest/notebooks_howto.html#notebooks-introduction>`_.
The notebook uses Python language. If this is completely new for you, I recommend to go through an introductory tutorial first. But the notebook is not too complicated and you can try it without being a Python expert.
