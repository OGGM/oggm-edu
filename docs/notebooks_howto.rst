Notebooks: introduction
=======================

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live computer code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. In OGGM-Edu, we use notebooks to design and share glacier modelling experiments.

If you are new to Jupyter Notebooks, we have prepared a tutorial! Open it in your browser with:

    :target: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/OGGM/oggm-edu/master?filepath=experiments%2Fgetting_started_with_notebooks.ipynb

Then choose the folder experiments. There the first notebook is getting_started_with_notebooks.

If you are also new to python, be patient! We will provide an introduction to python for OGGM-Edu users here soon.

Once you feel comfortable with Jupyter Notebooks, visit our :ref:`notebooks_list` list!
