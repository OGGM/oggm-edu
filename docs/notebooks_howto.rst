Notebooks: introduction
=======================

The `Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter.org>`_ is an **open-source web application**
that allows you to create and share documents that contain **live computer code**,
**equations**, **visualizations** and **narrative text**. In OGGM-Edu, we use
notebooks to design and share glacier modelling experiments.

If you are new to Jupyter Notebooks, don't be scared!

You can learn about them and try them out on the `Jupyter website <https://jupyter.org>`_ .

We also have prepared a tutorial for you on OGGM-Edu. Open it in your browser with:

If you are also new to python, be patient! We will provide an introduction to python for OGGM-Edu users here soon.

Once you feel comfortable with Jupyter Notebooks, visit our :ref:`notebooks_list` list!
