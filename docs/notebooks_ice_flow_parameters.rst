    Figure: Geometry of glacier models after 1500 years.  Blue graph: glacier moves by deformation, orange graph: glacier that slides also. 

In this notebook we will have a closer look at the parameters that describe ice flow: Glen's creep parameter and the sliding parameter. We will implement them in our model and see their influence on glacier flow.

*Prerequisites:* You went through the notebook about `glacier flowline modelling`_, so that you understand the concept of building a simple glacier model with OGGM.
