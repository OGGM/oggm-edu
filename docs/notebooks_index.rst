OGGM-Edu notebooks
==================

Currently we have 8 self-consistent notebooks for you to try out and adapt from!

* :doc:`notebooks/flowline_intro`: an introduction to flowline modelling with OGGM
* :doc:`notebooks/ice_flow_parameters`: a closer look at the parameters that describe ice flow: Glenâ€™s creep parameter and the sliding parameter
* :doc:`notebooks/surging_glaciers`: simulate glacier surging in a glacier model
* :doc:`notebooks/mass_balance_gradient`: how different mass balance gradients influence the growth of a glacier
* :doc:`notebooks/temperature_index_models`: general overview of temperature index melt models
* :doc:`notebooks/accumulation_and_ablation`: accumulation and ablation processes and how they determine glacier mass balance and ice flow
* :doc:`notebooks/advance_and_retreat`: concept of the equilibrium line altitude (ELA), and glacier advance and retreat in response to a change in the ELA
* :doc:`notebooks/real_glacier_simulations`:  evolution of real world glaciers using different climate scenarios to explain their influence on water availability in a catchment
