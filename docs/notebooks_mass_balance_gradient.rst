Mass balance gradient
=====================

In this notebook you will run experiments with a focus on the mass balance gradient. You will see how different mass balance gradients influence the growth of a glacier. Therefore, we calculate our glacier models until they reach an equilibrium state and compare length, area and volume. 

Open this experiment in your browser with the button below:

Then choose the folder experiments. There you find the notebook mass_balance_gradients.

*Prerequisits:* You went through the notebook about `glacier flowline modelling`_, so that you understand the concept of building a simple glacier model with OGGM.
