Mass balance gradient
=====================

In this notebook you will run experiments with a focus on the mass balance gradient. You will see how different mass balance gradients influence the growth of a glacier. Therefore, we calculate our glacier models until they reach an equilibrium state and compare length, area and volume. In addition, we will calculate the volume response times of the glacier models to small climatic changes.

Then choose the folder experiments. There you find the notebook mass_balance_gradients.

*Prerequisits:* You went through the notebook about `glacier flowline modelling`_, so that you understand the concept of building a simple glacier model with OGGM.
