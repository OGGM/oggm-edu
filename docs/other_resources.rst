Other educational resources
===========================

OGGM-Edu tries to find
its "niche" by providing interactive content focusing on numerical glacier
models. However, OGGM-Edu does not provide much theoretical background or
lecture materials. For more information about fundamentals,
check out these great online resources:

- `Antarctic Glaciers <http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/>`_: excellent resource
  to learn about glaciers (and not only those in Antarctica)
- `GlacierHub <https://glacierhub.org>`_: news and stories about glaciers from
  many disciplines
- `All about glaciers <https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glaciers>`_ from NSIDC
- `GRANTISM <http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~fpattyn/grantism/>`_, an ice-sheet
  model written in excel
- Hans Oerlemans's `Minimal Glacier Models <http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~oerle102/MM2011-all.pdf>`_
  book: a strong inspiration for this website
