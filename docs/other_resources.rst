Other educational resources
===========================

OGGM-Edu tries to follow its goal as provider of interactive content, focusing on numerical glacier
models. However, OGGM-Edu does not provide much theoretical background or
lecture materials. For more information about fundamentals,
check out these great online resources:

- `Antarctic Glaciers <http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/>`_: excellent resource
  to learn about glaciers (and not only those in Antarctica), for students at high school and 
  university level. Probably the most comprehensive online resource available: many of our tutorials 
  refer to pages in Antarctic Glaciers.
- `GlacierHub <https://glacierhub.org>`_: news and stories about glaciers from
  many disciplines.
- `The PROMICE ice school <http://isskolen.dk/wp/?page_id=7477>`_, an e-learning website for children
  aged 12 to 14, giving a basic introduction to ice and climate change.
- `All about glaciers <https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glaciers>`_ from NSIDC
- `GRANTISM <http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~fpattyn/grantism/>`_, an ice-sheet
  model written in excel (`online interactive version <http://www.martinoleary.com/jsism>`_)
- Hans Oerlemans's `Minimal Glacier Models <http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~oerle102/MM2011-all.pdf>`_
  book: a strong inspiration for this website
- `SwissEduc Glaciers online <https://www.swisseduc.ch/glaciers/>`_: a collection
  of glacier facts and photos.
- `World glacier monitoring service <https://wgms.ch/>`_: the reference for
  glacier observations and monitoring.
- `Cryosphere Software, Data and Tools <https://github.com/awesome-cryosphere/cryosphere-links>`_: This is a link list with awesome data, models, and tools around the cryosphere.
