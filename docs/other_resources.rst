Other glacier resources
=======================

There is plenty of other educational material online! OGGM Edu tries to find
its niche by providing interactive and modelling content, but it doesn't
provide theoretical lecture materials for example. If you are interested in
more, check out these great resources:

- `Antarctic Glaciers <http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/>`_: one of the best
  websites to learn about glaciers
- `All about glaciers <https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glaciers>`_ from NSIDC

:ref:`title_contact` if you'd like to add some more to this list!
