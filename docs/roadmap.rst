Contribute to OGGM-Edu
======================

As of June 2022, the OGGM-Edu platform features:

- 4 interactive web apps
- several jupyter notebooks templates in various complexity levels
- three series of glacier graphics
- bits of documentation for teachers about how to use the notebooks and MyBinder

We are proud of simple things, such as the the use of OGGM-Edu for a
class in Peru (`blog post <https://oggm.org/2019/12/06/OGGM-Edu-AGU/>`_),
or the positive feedback about the web applications and the use of
`classroom.oggm.org <https://classroom.oggm.org>`_
as a viable platform to run workshops and tutorials online.

This is great! But we also see that there is room for improvement, and we would
like to use this page to keep track of our
goals for the years to come. OGGM-Edu is meant to be a collaborative platform,
and we welcome any kind of contribution, from a typo correction to a new fully
fledged web app!

**If you want to participate**, here are some pointers to get you started.
Thanks so much for your help!

Help with typos, text, content, etc.
------------------------------------

Everything on this website is written by volunteers and non-native english
speakers. If you find mistakes or things you'd like to change, please do!
You can edit each file by following the "suggest edit" button at the top
of each page, or send us your modification suggestions per mail!

If you want to build the OGGM-Edu website locally to see your changes 
before publishing them online, see 
`these instructions <https://github.com/OGGM/oggm-edu/blob/master/BUILD_HOWTO.rst>`_.

Create new content
------------------

We welcome any new idea you may have: a new graphic, a new notebook, a new app...
You can decide to have it hosted here at edu.oggm.org (:ref:`reach out! <title_contact>`), or you can
decide to have it in your own namespace! Follow :ref:`these instructions <user_content>` if you'd
rather do the latter.

Prepare activity sheets for schools
-----------------------------------

If you are creating educational resources based on OGGM-Edu,
please :ref:`get in touch <title_contact>` so that we can advertise them!
See :ref:`classes_howto` for available examples.


Help translate OGGM-Edu
-----------------------

We are seeking to improve the usefulness of OGGM-Edu in non english speaking
groups. It is technically easy to do (we already have
template - dummy - pages for
`german <https://edu.oggm.org/de/latest/>`_,
`french <https://edu.oggm.org/fr/latest/>`_ and
`spanish <https://edu.oggm.org/es/latest/>`_ and we can easily add any other
language): the hard part is to actually *translate* the content and keep the
translations up to date ;-).

The translation files are located in the `docs/locale <https://github.com/OGGM/oggm-edu/tree/master/docs/locale>`_
folder: these `.po` files are like a dictionary that can be edited with a
simple text editor or dedicated tools (e.g. `poedit <https://poedit.net/>`_).
See `this file <https://github.com/OGGM/oggm-edu/blob/master/docs/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/alps_future.po>`_
for an example.

If you would like to help, grab these files and translate where you can! The translation
of even one single page would be very useful. We can provide support and advice with the languages
we can read (spanish, french, german).

Website design
--------------

(less important)

ReadTheDocs and Sphinx are great, but they have their limits. If you have
web skills and would like to make OGGM-Edu more appealing,
