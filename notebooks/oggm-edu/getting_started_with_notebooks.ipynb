    "Welcome to this introduction to [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)! Notebooks are interactive documents that originated from the python programming language, but has since been extended to other languages (it was previously called \"ipython notebook\", you will find it often with this name in forums or websites). The advantage of Jupyter notebooks is that they can include explanatory text, code, and plots in the same document. \n",
